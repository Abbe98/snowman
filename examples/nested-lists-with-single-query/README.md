# Fetch nested data with a single query

This example showcases which uses SPARQL's `GROUP_CONCAT` and Snowman's `split` functions to make/render nested lists without the need for multiple queries or views. Note that this method can in many cases be less-readable than using the inline `query` method or separate queries for multipage-views and regular views.
