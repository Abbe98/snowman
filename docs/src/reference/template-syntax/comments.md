# Comments

Comments are not rendered in the output. They are useful for adding notes to the source code that are not meant to be displayed in the output.

```
{{/* my very important comment */}}
```

Comments can span multiple lines.

```
{{/*
  This is a comment
  that spans multiple lines
*/}}
```

Comments can also contain trim markers to remove surrounding whitespace. To learn more about trim makers see the chapter on whitespace control.

```
{{- /* this is a comment with trim markers */ -}}
```
