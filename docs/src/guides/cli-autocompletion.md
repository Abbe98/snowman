# CLI autocompletion

The `completion` command can generate autocompletion scripts for the most common shells. It's recommended that you don't use these scripts directly as you would need to update them each time you update Snowman. Instead you should make your shell call this function.

To examplify, in the Fish shell you would use the following for autocompletion:


```fish
snowman completion fish | source
```
