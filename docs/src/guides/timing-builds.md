# Timing builds

Sometimes when you work on large sites, it can be useful to time your build processes to measure the impact of changes. All Snowman commands, therefore, have a flag named timeit. This prints a command's execution time to the console. While this is mostly useful for measuring build times, all Snowman commands support it.

```bash
snowman build --timeit
```
